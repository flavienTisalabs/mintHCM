# Code of Conduct

Our MintHCM community is built on the principles of inclusivity, mutual respect, and collaboration.

To ensure a welcoming and productive environment for all members, we ask that you adhere to the following MintHCM Community Code of Conduct:

## Be Respectful
Treat all community members with kindness and professionalism. We embrace diversity and expect everyone to show respect for individuals of all backgrounds and identities. Harassment, discrimination, and any form of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.

## Maintain Professionalism
Refrain from using language or images that are sexualized or inappropriate. Avoid making unwelcome advances or engaging in behavior that could be interpreted as such. Personal attacks, trolling, and political discussions have no place in our community.

## Respect Privacy
Protect the privacy of others by refraining from sharing personal information without explicit consent. This includes physical addresses, email addresses, and any other private data.

## Remain Objective
Focus on technical discussions and problem-solving. Emotions are natural, but negative emotions should not drive interactions. Assume good intentions from others and strive to find constructive solutions to technical challenges.

## Act Responsibly
Consider the impact of your actions on the community and the project as a whole. Be transparent about any affiliations and ensure that your contributions benefit the collective effort. Adhere to security best practices and report any vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Support Learning
Welcome users of all skill levels and be patient with those who are new to MintHCM. Encourage learning and provide assistance to those who seek it. Utilize documentation and search for solutions before asking for help.

## Combat Spam
Maintain the integrity of our community by refraining from unsolicited advertising or spamming. Contributions should add value to the discussion and refrain from promotional content without substance.

## Contribute Back
Embrace the spirit of open source by actively participating in the community. Offer assistance, contribute code, provide support, document features, test software, translate content, or promote MintHCM in your own way.

## Be Patient and Grateful
Recognize that community contributions are voluntary and may take time. Exercise patience and gratitude towards those who generously give their time and expertise to the project.

## Report Violations
If you witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the community moderators at contact@minthcm.org. All reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly.

We reserve the right to remove any content or suspend individuals who violate these guidelines. This Code of Conduct applies to all community interactions, whether within project spaces or in public forums where you represent MintHCM.
